### Working-with-Google-Api-for-Advertising

This is a self project on working with log files generated.

In this project, we will segregate log file based on different phone identifiers namely, GDIP and IDFA. 
These identifiers are just unique advertising id's based upon android and apple iphone.

So, whenver you click and advertisment from a phone, a unique entry in the log file is generated, using the unique android/apple
id or also called advertising id of the phone.

We will create separate dataframes for such devices and using google api's we will check the status of each id.

This is a project done as a part for INMOBI datascience/coding challenge.
